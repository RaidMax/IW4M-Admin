#### Player Identification
All players are identified 5 separate ways   
1. `npID/GUID/XUID` - The ID corresponding to the player's hardware or forum account   
2. `IP` - The player's IP Address   
3. `Client ID` - The internal reference to a player, generated by **IW4MAdmin**   
4. `Name` - The visible player name as it appears in game   
5. `Client Number` - The slot the client occupies on a server. (The number ranges between 0 and the max number of clients allowed on the server)

For most commands players are identified by their `Name`  
However, if they are currently offline, or their name contains un-typable characters, their `Client ID` must be used   

The `Client ID` is specified by prefixing a player's reference number with `@`.  
For example, `@123` would reference the player with a `Client ID` of 123.  

**All commands that require a `target` look at the `first argument` for a form of player identification**

`setlevel`
- _shortcut_ - `sl`
- _Parameter 1_ - Player to modify level of
- _Parameter 2_ - Level to set the player to ```[ User, Trusted, Moderator, Administrator, SeniorAdmin, Owner ]```
- _Example_ - `!setlevel Player1 SeniorAdmin`, `!sl @123 Moderator`
- **NOTE** - An `owner` cannot set another player's level to `owner` unless the configuration option is enabled during setup

`ban`
- _Shortcut_ - `b`
- _Parameter 1_ - Player to ban
- _Parameter 2_ - Reason for ban
- _Example_ - `!ban Player1 caught cheating`, `!b @123 GUID Spoofing`

### Game Log Server
The game log server provides a way to remotely host your server's log over a http rest-ful api. 
This feature is useful if you plan on running IW4MAdmin on a different machine than the game server.
#### Requirements
- [Python 3.8.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer

#### Installation
1. With Python 3.x installed, open up a terminal/command prompt window in the `GameLogServer` folder and execute:
    ```console
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If this fails, you can alternatively try installing with:
    ```console
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Allow TCP port 1625 through firewall  
    * [Windows Instructions](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-open-firewall-ports-in-windows-10,36451.html)
    * [Linux Instructions (iptables)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-basic-iptables-firewall-on-centos-6#open-up-ports-for-selected-services)
#### Launching  
With Python 3 installed, open a terminal/command prompt window open in the `GameServerLog`  folder and execute:
```console
python runserver.py
```
The Game Log Server window will need to remain running/open as long as **IW4MAdmin** is running

#### Configuring
* Update your `IW4MAdminSettings.json` by changing the value of `GameLogServerUrl` to "http://<remote_server_ip>:1625"
* Example &mdash; `"GameLogServerUrl": "http://192.168.1.123:1625",`

### Extending Plugins

#### NuGet Package
The NuGet package for **IW4MAdmin's** "Shared Library" can be obtained from the [NuGet Gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RaidMax.IW4MAdmin.SharedLibraryCore)
Referencing this package will give you the ability to write plugins against **IW4MAdmin's** core library.
#### Code
**IW4MAdmin's** functionality can be extended by writing additional plugins in C#.  
Each class library must implement the `IPlugin` interface.   
See the existing [plugins](https://github.com/RaidMax/IW4M-Admin/tree/master/Plugins) for examples.
#### JavaScript
**IW4MAdmin** functionality can also be extended using JavaScript.
The JavaScript parser supports [ECMA 5.1](https://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) standards.
#### Plugin Object Template
In order to be properly parsed by the JavaScript engine, every plugin must conform to the following template.
```js
var plugin = {
    author: 'YourHandle',
    version: 1.0,
    name: 'Sample JavaScript Plugin',

    onEventAsync: function (gameEvent, server) {
    },

    onLoadAsync: function (manager) {
    },

    onUnloadAsync: function () {
    },

    onTickAsync: function (server) {
    }
};
```
#### Required Properties
- `author` &mdash; [string] Author of the plugin (usually your name or online name/alias)
- `version` &mdash; [float] Version number of your plugin (useful if you release several different versions)
- `name` &mdash; [string] Name of your plugin (be descriptive!)
- `onEventAsync` &mdash; [function] Handler executed when an event occurs
    - `gameEvent` &mdash; [parameter object] Object containing event type, origin, target, and other info (see the GameEvent class declaration)
    - `server` &mdash; [parameter object] Object containing information and methods about the server the event occured on (see the Server class declaration)  
- `onLoadAsync` &mdash; [function] Handler executed when the plugin is loaded by code
    - `manager` &mdash; [parameter object] Object reference to the application manager (see the IManager interface definition) 
- `onUnloadAsync` &mdash; [function] Handler executed when the plugin is unloaded by code (see live reloading)
- `onTickAsync` &mdash; [function] Handler executed approximately once per second by code *(unimplemented as of version 2.\*)*
    - `server` &mdash; [parameter object] Object containing information and methods about the server the event occured on (see the Server class declaration) 
### Live Reloading
Thanks to JavaScript's flexibility and parsability, the plugin importer scans the plugins folder and reloads the JavaScript plugins on demand as they're modified. This allows faster development/testing/debugging.

---
### Misc
#### Anti-cheat
This is an [IW4x](https://iw4xcachep26muba.onion.link/) only feature (wider game support planned), that uses analytics to detect aimbots and aim-assist tools.  
To utilize anti-cheat, enable it during setup **and** copy `_customcallbacks.gsc` from `userraw` into your `IW4x Server\userraw\scripts` folder.  

The anti-cheat feature is a work in progress and as such will be constantly tweaked and may not be 100% accurate, however the goal is to deter as many cheaters as possible from IW4x.
#### Database Storage
By default, all **IW4MAdmin** information is stored in `Database.db`. 

Should you need to reset your database, this file can simply be deleted.  
Additionally, this file should be preserved during updates to retain client information.   

Setting the `ConnectionString` and `DatabaseProvider` properties in `IW4MAdminSettings.json`  
will allow **IW4MAdmin** to use alternate methods for database storage
